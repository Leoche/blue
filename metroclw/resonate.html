<big style="font-family: Calibri;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Resonate
is an initiative that brings young Christians together from all around
Adelaide.<br>
We meet at different Churches and services throughout the year to
worship God as a community.
Resonate events provide a great opportunity to catch up with friends
from camps, bible studies, small groups, school, youth, church,
anywhere!
Have an amazing time together and be encouraged, challenged and
empoweredby your brothers and sisters in Christ.<br>

&nbsp;In an orchestra, when all the musicians play notes at the right
frequency, they resonate together to create a beautiful symphony. We
are so excited to see everyone meeting together in worship, praising
our God as one, loving, supporting and spurring each other on (Hebrews
10:23-25), as God&rsquo;s symphony. This vision is one reason for the
name Resonate. Also, a resonating frequency often impacts other
objects, causing them to resonate together. We believe that this
initiative will bring churches together; forming a community that is
able to impact other communities with God&rsquo;s love.<br>

Christian Life Week wants to impact in a way that resonates throughout
the rest of<br>
campers and leaders&rsquo; lives. What better way to continue the
resounding, than to meet as a<br>
community outside of camp to continue the worship and fellowship.</span></big>
